# Building a Global Data Fabric with MapR (now HPE)

This demo contains everything necessary to build an edge-to-cloud data fabric using MapR.

It comes in three variants: an **HQ** version, an **EDGE** version, and a **Cloud** version. The **HQ** version is standalone. Use this by itself to demonstrate microservice architectures and data processing pipelines. The **EDGE** version can only work in conjunction with the HQ version, using two clusters to demonstrate data replication. The **Cloud** version simply aggregates data from across the fabric for (for example) ML and data science initiatives.

To install the demo, run *install-demo-<variant>.sh*.  Run the app using *run-<variant>Dashboard.sh*.  Follow the instructions to establish a connection from a web browser.
